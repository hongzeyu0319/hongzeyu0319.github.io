I'm a PhD Candidate in ECE department at the University of Michigan, advised by Prof. Yun Jiang and Prof. Jeffrey A. Fessler. My current research focuses on accelerated MRI reconstruction using self‑supervised deep learning methods. I’m also interested in quantitative MRI, sampling‑trajectory optimization, and inverse problems more broadly. Outside of research, I enjoy (gravel) cycling, tennis, and road trips.
